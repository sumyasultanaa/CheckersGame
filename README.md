# README.md for Checkers

Checkers is played by two people who oppose each other across a board of 64 light and dark squares, the same as a chessboard. The 24 playing pieces are disk-shaped and of contrasting colors. At the start of the game, each contestant has 12 pieces arranged on the board. The notation used in describing the game is based on numbering the squares on the board. The black pieces always occupy squares 1 to 12, and the white pieces invariably rest on squares 21 to 32.

The RED pieces are $. The black pieces are @
E denotes empty spots.
Only diagonal moves are allowed by jumping over opponent pieces to capture pieces. One player has the dark pieces; the other has the light pieces. Players alternate turns, and a player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square that is denoted by E. 
If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is empty or unoccupied, the piece may be captured by jumping over it. These rules are accounted for in our code.
